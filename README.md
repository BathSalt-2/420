# Or4cl3AI Ethical Hacking Toolkit

Or4cl3AI Ethical Hacking Toolkit is a collection of Python scripts designed for various ethical hacking and security testing purposes. This toolkit provides a range of functionalities to help security professionals and enthusiasts assess and identify vulnerabilities in systems and applications.

**Disclaimer:** This toolkit is intended for educational and ethical purposes only. Users are responsible for ensuring their actions comply with all applicable laws and regulations. The developers assume no liability and are not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this program.

## Features

This toolkit includes the following modules and functionalities:

*   **Ultimate AI Ethical Hacking Assistant (`ultimate_ai_ethical_hacking_assistant.py`)**: The main script that orchestrates and provides access to the various tools within the toolkit.
*   **Brute Force Attacks (`brute_force_attacks.py`)**: Implements functionalities for performing brute force attacks on POST data, headers, and authentication mechanisms.
*   **Proxy Support (`proxy_support.py`)**: Enables routing traffic through proxies, including support for multiple proxies and SOCKS.
*   **Multi-Threading (`multi_threading.py`)**: Provides basic multi-threading capabilities to run tasks concurrently.
*   **HTTP Password Attacks (`http_password_attacks.py`)**: Specialized scripts for brute-forcing HTTP passwords.
*   **POST/GET Brute Forcing (`post_get_brute_forcing.py`)**: Tools for systematically testing POST and GET request parameters.
*   **Colored HTML Output (`colored_html_output.py`)**: Utility for generating colored HTML output, likely for better visualization of results.
*   **Time Delay (`time_delay.py`)**: Allows for configuring time delays between requests, which can be crucial for avoiding detection.
*   **Cookie Manipulation (`cookie_manipulation.py`)**: Tools for modifying and experimenting with HTTP cookies.
*   **User Interface (`user_interface.py`)**: Script focused on providing a user-friendly interface and ensuring device compatibility.
*   **Edge Computing (`edge_computing.py`)**: Module related to edge computing tasks (specific functionality might require deeper inspection).
*   **Tor Support (`tor_support.py`)**: Integrates support for routing traffic through the Tor network and custom VPNs for anonymity.
*   **Self-Destruct (`self_destruct.py`)**: An advanced feature for securely destroying data or the toolkit itself.

## Tech Stack

*   **Primary Language**: Python
*   **Version Control**: Git
*   **Core Modules**: The toolkit leverages various standard Python libraries and custom modules for its functionalities. (Refer to individual script imports for specific dependencies if needed).

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    While not explicitly listed in a single requirements file, individual scripts might have dependencies (e.g., the `requests` library). Ensure you have Python installed. You may need to install libraries on a case-by-case basis if import errors occur:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    # Add other pip install commands if specific dependencies are identified
    ```

3.  **Run the Main Assistant**:
    The primary way to use the toolkit is through the `ultimate_ai_ethical_hacking_assistant.py` script:
    ```bash
    python ultimate_ai_ethical_hacking_assistant.py
    ```
    This script provides a central point to access the various features of the toolkit. Follow any on-screen prompts or instructions provided by the user interface.

4.  **Using Individual Scripts**:
    Alternatively, many of the scripts (e.g., `brute_force_attacks.py`, `http_password_attacks.py`) can be used or modified independently if you need to perform a specific task. You would typically run them as standard Python scripts:
    ```bash
    python name_of_script.py
    ```
    You might need to modify the script parameters or input data as required.

**Note**: Always ensure you have permission to test any target systems. Unauthorized hacking is illegal.
